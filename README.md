Part 1: Map
Implement a group of C++ classes that implement a map for the game of Risk. The map must be implemented as a connected graph,
where each node represents a country. Edges between nodes represent adjacency between countries. Continents must be implemented
as connected subgraphs, where each country belongs to one and only one continent. Each country is owned by a player and contain armies.
